# Challenge-1

## Criteria 1: Semantic HTML Elements

The innitial html code given uses 'div' tags instead of proper html semantics like 'header', 'aside', 'section' and 'article' which consist of the basic elements. In order to have a proper semantic structure, I replace every tag with '<div>' for the proper semantic equivalent, results shown in the following image:

##### Note: The tag 'span' wasnÂ´t changed as it was necessary for the divison and conexion in the css.style file and did not interrupt a proper semantic flow.
